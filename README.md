5th Sprint

◾You’ll need to create a new repository for this sprint.

◾You can use your 1st sprint as template, contemplating the improvements you did along the rest of the sprints.

◾You’ll have to upgrade your app taking advantage of Vue.js.

◾We’ll be using CDN, so remember to copy the script and add it to your html files.

◾Don’t forget to add the id=”app” to the container in which you’ll be using Vue.

◾You can work with as many JS files as you had with JavaScript Vanilla or use just one.

◾Remember that from now on Vue will be on charge of the DOM.

◾The expected product will be the same as for the forth sprint.

◾Once you’re done with your work add, commit and push your project to the new repository.

◾Submit your sprint leaving the link to your GitHub repository.
